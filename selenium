The full name is 'selenium webdriver'. By name, it suggests that it's 
driver for web. Most likely, Selenium is a program which can drive a web
browser. We can say to selenium what we want to drive. So it's sort of
mediator bw us and browser.

user --> selenium(receives bunch of instructions) --> drives web browser

"Selenium WebDriver drives a browser natively, as a real user would, 
either locally or on remote machines." - official source
